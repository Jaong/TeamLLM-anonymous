This directory is used to store LLMs' outputs. 

The **Answer** folder contains the generated responses and includes a total of **20 subfolders**, namely **A01–A10** (TeamLLM condition) and **B01–B10** (Baseline condition).

Each subfolder corresponds to one LLM. Within each subfolder, there are **10 Word files**, each representing the LLM's responses to one of the **ten scenarios**.

Each Word file contains a **7-row, 1-column table**:
- **Row 1**: the **Response ID** of this answer
- **Rows 2–7**: the LLM's responses to **Step-1 through Step-6** for the corresponding scenario, in order


**NOTE: We commit to releasing all model response Word files upon paper acceptance.**
