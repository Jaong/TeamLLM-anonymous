The key verb phrase should contain one active verb (e.g., increase, enhance, assist, limit), corresponding to what must be done in Step 3. Avoid absolute or overly broad verbs, as well as multiple verbs.\n4.Purpose: Typically expressed with phrases such as “in order to” or “so that” to clarify the intended goal of the key verb phrase.\n5.Future scenario parameters: Include the three parameters of time, location, and theme."
